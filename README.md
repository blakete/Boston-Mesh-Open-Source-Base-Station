## BitChat Relay & Base Station

**Part of the [Boston Mesh Project](https://primal.net/p/nprofile1qqsfccxvukwe8vnqwcd6t5l4kvjnl32jt6spcjpv6w7whyx54s9uhzs8v35q7)**

An open-source **relay and base station node** for the [BitChat]([https://example.com](https://github.com/permissionlesstech/bitchat/tree/main)) peer-to-peer messaging app and protocol.
Built to extend BitChat's range, reliability, and resilience across the city of Boston and beyond!

### ðŸŽ¯ Initial Goal

Deploy mesh-connected Raspberry Pi nodes that:

* **Relay BLE messages** to extend wireless coverage.
* **Store and forward** encrypted messages when peers are offline.
* **Bridge local BitChat traffic** across long-range radio or IP backhaul to connect distant mesh clusters.
