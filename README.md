## BitChat Relay & Base Station

**Part of the [Boston Mesh Project](https://primal.net/p/nprofile1qqsfccxvukwe8vnqwcd6t5l4kvjnl32jt6spcjpv6w7whyx54s9uhzs8v35q7)**

An open-source **relay and base station node** for the [BitChat]([https://example.com](https://github.com/permissionlesstech/bitchat/tree/main)) peer-to-peer messaging app and protocol.
Built to extend BitChat's range, reliability, and resilience across the city of Boston and beyond!

### ðŸŽ¯ Initial Goal

Build a cheap, open source BitChat base station & relay to extend peer discovery and messaging across Boston. Mobile phones running BitChat can connect via BLE or LAN/IP (e.g., at home), and the base station uses P2P radio links and existing internet infrastructure to join and maintain the wider mesh network.
