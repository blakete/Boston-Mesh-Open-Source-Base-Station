| Info Column Text | Protocol | Detailed Explanation |
|------------------|----------|----------------------|
| (Empty) | LE LL | Generic Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Link Layer packet. This likely represents a standard LE LL PDU where Wireshark does not display specific info, possibly a data channel packet or an unrecognized type with length 56 bytes. In BLE, LE LL encompasses all link layer communications, including advertising, scanning, and data exchange. |
| ADV_IND | LE LL | Connectable undirected advertising packet. Sent by a BLE peripheral to broadcast its presence, allowing any central device to connect or request more information via scan. It is scannable and connectable, often used for initial device discovery. |
| ADV_NONCONN_IND | LE LL | Non-connectable undirected advertising packet. Used for broadcasting data (e.g., beacons) without allowing connections or scan requests. It reduces power consumption by not requiring the advertiser to listen for responses. |
| SCAN_REQ | LE LL | Scan request packet. Sent by a scanning device on primary advertising channels to request additional data from an advertiser that supports scannable advertising (e.g., in response to ADV_IND or ADV_SCAN_IND). |
| AUX_SCAN_REQ | LE LL | Auxiliary scan request packet. Introduced in Bluetooth 5 for extended advertising, sent on secondary channels to request more data from an advertiser using extended PDUs. |
| AUX_CONNECT_REQ | LE LL | Auxiliary connection request packet. Used in Bluetooth 5 extended advertising on secondary channels to initiate a connection with an advertiser. |
| AUX_CONNECT_RSP | LE LL | Auxiliary connection response packet. Sent by the peripheral in response to an AUX_CONNECT_REQ on secondary channels, acknowledging and completing the connection initiation in extended advertising scenarios. |
| Control Opcode: LL_CONNECTION_PARAM_REQ | LE LL | Link Layer control PDU for requesting changes to connection parameters. Sent during an established connection to negotiate adjustments like connection interval, slave latency, or supervision timeout for optimizing power or throughput. |
| Control Opcode: LL_PHY_UPDATE_IND | LE LL | Link Layer control PDU for indicating or updating the physical layer (PHY) mode. Used to switch between PHY options (e.g., 1M, 2M, or coded PHY) in Bluetooth 5+ for better range or speed during a connection. |
| Control Opcode: Unknown | LE LL | Unrecognized Link Layer control opcode. This indicates a control PDU with an opcode not known to Wireshark, possibly due to a custom implementation, protocol extension, or parsing error. |
| Empty PDU | LE LL | Empty Protocol Data Unit. Used in connection events to maintain synchronization or acknowledge packets without transmitting data. It ensures the connection stays active even when there is no payload, occurring at each connection interval if no data is sent. |
| L2CAP Fragment | LE LL | Fragment of a Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol (L2CAP) PDU. In BLE, L2CAP handles higher-level data multiplexing and segmentation; this represents a continued piece of a larger L2CAP packet broken into smaller fragments for transmission over the link layer. |
| L2CAP Fragment Start | LE LL | Start of a fragmented L2CAP PDU. Marks the beginning of a segmented L2CAP packet, indicating that the full data will follow in subsequent fragments due to size limits (e.g., max 22-27 bytes per PDU in legacy BLE). |
| Transaction Start | BT Mesh PB-ADV | Bluetooth Mesh Provisioning Bearer Advertising packet indicating the start of a transaction. PB-ADV is a bearer used during device provisioning in Bluetooth Mesh networks, broadcasting provisioning PDUs over advertising channels to add new devices to the mesh network securely. |
| Unknown | LE LL | Unrecognized LE LL packet. This could be due to an unknown PDU type, corrupted data, or a proprietary extension not supported by Wireshark's dissector, with the specified length (e.g., 61 bytes) providing the only clue.
